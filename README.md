# BNR exercise

Please limit your time working on this exercise to four hours.

## Spec

Please create a React and Redux application implementing the following feature: displaying blog post data from the following web service:

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

1. Display the posts for the current user in the left column, and posts for all other users in the right column. For the purposes of this exercise, you can hard-code the “current user ID” to 1
2. Handle both loading and error states.
3. Cover all the important behavior of the code with automated tests. Feel free to choose between end-to-end tests and unit/component tests.
4. Add enough CSS to get the left/right column layout and make it look clean, but don’t worry about too fancy styling.
When you're done, zip up the project and email it back to me.

Feel free to reach out to Josh Justice jjustice@bignerdranch.com with questions!
